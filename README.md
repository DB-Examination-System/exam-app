Windows Examination System
Overview
🚀 We are thrilled to announce the completion of our latest project: a Windows Examination System developed with EF and SQL Server! This system is designed to cater to three main user roles: students, instructors, and administrators.

Our system generates exams randomly from a bank of questions for every course, and it supports exporting PDF reports for various purposes such as student grades, track-specific student data, data related to instructor courses, exam questions, and student exam answers.
